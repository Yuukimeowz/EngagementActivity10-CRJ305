    <p class="square">The representations of different groups have become powerful symbols of access, equality, and influence. Participation in the occupation of law enforcement symbolizes equality and socioeconomic opportunities for female police officers, but more importantly, women’s participation in the institution of policing symbolizes women’s right to stand beside, instead of behind, men in exercising state-sanctioned acts of formal social control <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/1557085117753668"><i>(Schuck,2018)

         <p>Do you have what it takes to help others? With the job the highs come with the pay and benefits. The challenge of the job and the ability to transfer to other federal agencies from experiences gives many women the chance to succeed to the field they would later like to join (Belknap, 2020). </p>

    <ul>
            <li>According to the national institute of justice, across the Country, about 1/8 of Law Enforcement officers are women in each department. Meaning there is usually a large smaller amount of women than men in each department. Scholars recognize that the percentage of women in police organizations is not representative of the communities they serve <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/2153368715575376"><i>(Morabito & Shelley, 2015)
            </a>.</i></li>
        <br>
            <li>Female officers less likely to agree that aggressive tactics are sometimes necessary. 22% of women and 35% of men said they had physically struggled with suspect. 11% of women and 30% of men report that they have ever fired weapon on duty <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/17/female-police-officers-on-the-job-experiences-diverge-from-those-of-male-officers/"><i>(Pew Research Center)
            </a>.</i></li>
        <br>
            <li> Decades of gender discrimination have stymied the robust presence of women in leadership positions in American policing. Moreover, historic patterns of exclusion have led to problems of attrition whereby women in frontline positions either opt out of the promotion process or leave policing altogether before they can advance to the upper echelons—a trend referred to as a leaking pipeline (Bailyn, 2003).

<center><h3>Increasing female representation...</h3></center>
<p>It been identified as one possible strategy for creating justice-focused organizations that are more responsive to public needs <a href="https://cops.usdoj.gov/ric/Publications/cops-p311-pub.pdf"><i> (President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, 2015; Silvestri, 2015)
</a>.</i></p>
<p>Agencies with a greater number of female officers are more effective in identifying and clearing sexual violence cases compared with agencies with fewer female officers <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/0020852315619222"><i>(Meier & Nicholson-Crotty, 2006; Walfield, 2016)</a>.</i> Representation is hypothesized to strengthen citizens’ participation in the decision-making process and to increase their cooperation in interactions with specific bureaucratic agents (Riccucci, Van Ryzin, & Lavena, 2014).
</p> 
  <p> Women in Law enforcement are responsible for enforcing laws, maintaining public order, and managing public safety. Women Handle duties of investigation, apprehension, and detention of individuals suspected of criminal offenses. Having more women in law departments will benefit the field with different points of view and approaches that come from different life experiences. A multiplicity of perspectives can spark creativity and innovation, and help departments spot and seize new opportunities. </P>
